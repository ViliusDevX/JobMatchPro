üì± JobMatchPro

JobMatchPro is a personal app I developed using Python and the KivyMD library. It began as my final project for the ITFightClub Python course, and I invested a lot of time and money into building it.

While I currently don‚Äôt have the source code available, I plan to upload it once I recover it.

üîß How it Works

Upon launching the app, users are presented with 21 multiple-choice questions designed to evaluate their personality, preferences, and career motivations.
For example:
‚ÄúWhat motivates you the most in a job?‚Äù

  1. "Helping others"

  2. "Creativity and innovation"

  3. "Financial stability"

Once all questions are answered, users tap the "Submit" button. The app then sends the response data to the Simple ChatGPT API (https://rapidapi.com/LightningDev/api/simple-chatgpt-api), along with a prompt asking it to:

  Suggest 10 suitable career paths

  Include average salary info

  Evaluate how "future-proof" each job is (AI replacement risk level)

  Recommend the best countries for each role

The AI response is then displayed in a clean and readable pop-up format.
