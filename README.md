# JobMatchPro
This is my personal Python app development project. Sadly at this moment i don't have the source code, however if i will find it, i will definetely upload it.

This project started as my ItFightClub Python learning course (https://itfightclub.lt/) final project, i've put a lot of time and some money into this app.

This app uses Python KivyMD library. When opening the app, user sees 21 question with 3 possible answer options (e.g. "What motivates you the most in a job?" 1. "Helping others", 2. "Creativity and innovation", 3. "Financial stability" etc.), when user selects all answers, he presses "Submit" button, it sends all user's answers to Simple ChatGPT API (https://rapidapi.com/LightningDev/api/simple-chatgpt-api) with a prompt asking to offer 10 most suitable job positions, salary, Future-proof (is it likely to be replaced by AI) and best countries for that job. It then depicts a pop-up with answer from AI in more readable template.
